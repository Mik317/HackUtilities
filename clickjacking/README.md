This tool is a very simple utility that can be used for test website against clickacking attacks simply creating an iframe page in HTML
and displaing it in the favorite browser of the user.

If the page will be displayed in the iframe, the page is vulnerable to clickjacking;
In negative cases, youcan open the `Console` in the browser for the causes of the error (like CSP violation or X-Frame-Option = SAMORIGIN).
